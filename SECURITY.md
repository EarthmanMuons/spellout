# Security Policy

Although our software has not yet reached version 1.0 and is not officially
supported, we are committed to addressing security concerns and ensuring the
safety of our project and its users. As our project develops, we will continue
to enhance and update our security policy.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported         |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| < 1.0.0 | :x: Not Supported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please refrain from reporting security vulnerabilities through public GitHub
issues.**

To report vulnerabilities privately, please open a [draft security advisory][1]
on the repository, including as much detail as possible. This approach allows us
to collaborate with you to resolve the issue before it becomes publicly known,
minimizing the risk of exploitation before a patch is released.

Our project is maintained by a dedicated team of volunteers who work on a
reasonable-effort basis. As a result, we kindly request that you provide us with
a minimum of 90 days to address the vulnerability. We appreciate your
responsible disclosure.
